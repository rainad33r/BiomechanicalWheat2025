# BiomechanicalWheat2025 USRA Repo
Compiled files of all items worked on over the summer for the wheat testing for lodging parameters. 

You can find my final poster with data from this repo [here](/FinalPoster.pdf)!

## Project Sections
Links will navigate you to specific portions of the project completed  

### Physical Design

For more information on the specifications that went into the physical design, please navigate to the [Physical Design Readme](/PhysicalDesign/README-physicalDesign.md)

> Engineering drawings and references used when modelling the full design. Many are images taken straight from my notebook. </br>[Design Files](/PhysicalDesign/DesignFiles/)

> Includes visual references for machining and STL files of the physical model </br> [Model Files (autodesk inventor)](/PhysicalDesign/modelling)

### Code

> Code used in the field with a Phidget wheatstone bridge, load cell and HUB - Python</br> [Load Cell Acquisition Code](/Code/LoadAcquistion.py)

> Code used to isolate and measure the wheat head motion - MATLAB </br>[Colour Thresholding Code](/Code/ColourThresholding)

> Code used to calculate the cross-sectional area of imaged stems (Images must have a black background to work, images captured with AMScope camera in SpecLab)</br>[Cross-Section Analysis Code](/Code/CrossSectionAnalyzer.m)

> Displays an elastic rod beam with variable damping, stiffness and applied force, code must be implemented with artisynth found [here](https://www.artisynth.org/Main/HomePage)</br>[Simulation Code](/Code/ElasticRod.java)

### Data Collected

For more information on the collected data and the possible next steps resulting from that can be found at this [ReadMe](/CollectedData/README-Data.md). 

> Data collected from the four-point bend test and cross-section analysis </br>[Material Testing](/CollectedData/MaterialsTesting)

> Analysis of material testing data</br>[Material Testing Analysis](/CollectedData/MaterialTestingAnalysis.xlsx)

> Videos and Images of the apparatus in the field </br> [Image Capture](/CollectedData/Video)

> Captured data and analysis of captred load cell data in the field </br> [Load Cell Data](/CollectedData/LoadCellTesting.xlsx)
