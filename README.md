# BiomechanicalWheat2025
Compiled files of all items worked on over the summer for the wheat testing for lodging parameters. 

You can find my final poster with data from this repo [here](/FinalPoster.pdf)!

## Project Sections
Links will navigate you to specific portions of the project completed  

### Physical Design

> Engineering drawings and references used when modelling the full design. Many are images taken straight from my notebook. </br>[Design Files](/PhysicalDesign/DesignFiles/)

> Includes visual references for machining and STL files of the physical model </br> [Model Files (autodesk inventor)](/PhysicalDesign/modelling)

### Code

> Code used in the field with a Phidget wheatstone bridge, load cell and HUB - Python</br> [Load Cell Acquisition Code](/Code/LoadAcquistion.py)

> Code used to isolate and measure the wheat head motion - MATLAB </br>[Colour Thresholding Code](/Code/ColourThresholding)

> Code used to calculate the cross-sectional area of imaged stems (Images must have a black background to work, images captured with AMScope camera in SpecLab)</br>[Cross-Section Analysis Code](/Code/CrossSectionAnalyzer.m)

> Displays an Elastic-Rod with variable damping, stiffness and applied force, code must be implemented with artisynth found [here](https://www.artisynth.org/Main/HomePage)</br>[Simulation Code](/Code/ElasticRod.java)

### Data Collected

> Data collected from the four-point bend test and cross-section analysis </br>[Material Testing](/CollectedData/MaterialTesting)

> Analysis of material testing data</br>[Material Testing Analysis](/CollectedData/MaterialTestingAnalysis.xlsx)

> Videos and Images of the apparatus in the field </br> [Image Capture](/CollectedData/Video)
