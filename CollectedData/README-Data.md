# Data Collection Review

## Image Capture
</br>
The videos captured from both the manual and cart showed promise for oscillation of the wheat, however, a few parameters of the design may need to change to for further implementation. 

1. Larger Displacement and larger barrier from external wheat. 
    - The current displacement does not push the wheat nearly as much to enforce a side-to-side oscillation (currently still very front and back) and external wheat can still break through the 'arm' and triangle barriers on the side (slip underneath) further impeding results. 
        - A thicker bar (currently 1'' thick) could be implemented and possibly improve conditions.

2. Secure the main triangle more.
    - While the triangle did work and held its own against the wheat, the frame itself was experiencing lots of motion when the cart moved along with it. 
        - This can be possibly changed with using thicker bars that extend down, rather than the 1'' bars that were used for the entire design.

3. Make variable height easier to achieve.
    - While the curent height was sufficiet for our purposes, extending the traingle and arm further down into the field may show better promise for the actual oscillation rather than the head.
