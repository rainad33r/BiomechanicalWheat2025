# Data Collection Review

## Image Capture

The videos captured from both the manual and cart showed promise for oscillation of the wheat, however, a few parameters of the design may need to change to for further implementation. 

1. Larger Displacement and larger barrier from external wheat. 
    - The current displacement does not push the wheat nearly as much to enforce a side-to-side oscillation (currently still very front and back) and external wheat can still break through the 'arm' and triangle barriers on the side (slip underneath) further impeding results. 
        - A thicker bar (currently 1'' thick) could be implemented and possibly improve conditions.

2. Secure the main triangle more.
    - While the triangle did work and held its own against the wheat, the frame itself was experiencing lots of motion when the cart moved along with it. 
        - This can be possibly changed with using thicker bars that extend down, rather than the 1'' bars that were used for the entire design.

3. Make variable height easier to achieve.
    - While the curent height was sufficiet for our purposes, extending the traingle and arm further down into the field may show better promise for the actual oscillation rather than the head. 

## Load Cell

Data collected by the load cell was also interesting to disect. With the main portion of the in-field collection oscillating quite a bit on a downward motion. There are a few ideals for the future use of the load cell, if it were to be used with the cart again.

1. Test the possibility of the load cell acting like an accelerometer. 
    - The cart in motion tended to show an increase on the load data collected.
        - This can be tested by simply measuring the load during a speed up and slow down test. 

2. If the load cell is acting like an accelerometer, move the cart at a slower pace. 

Finally, it was found that in combination with the side to side movement of the main design, the load cell would measure that motion as a load instead of the wheat stems. This can be possibly reduced with a more secure design as stated in the previous section.
